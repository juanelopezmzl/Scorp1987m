[Heroku CLI installation instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)
: Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages. If you are deploying on own server or other cloud service, you don't need to install this.

```
git clone https://github.com/Scorp1987/InnGangBot
cd InnGangBot
```
You now have a functioning Git repository that contains this application as well as a package.json file, which is used by Nodeâ€™s dependency manager

# 3. Open Heroku Account

In this step, a free heroku account is created to host the application on the cloud server.

[Sign Up Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com)

# 4. Deply the App : Using Heroku

In this step you will deploy the app to Heroku.

Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive the source code.
```
heroku create {ApplicationName}
```
A git remote (called heroku) is also created in the local git respository when an heroku app is created.
Heroku generates a random name if you don't provide {ApplicationName}

To deploy the source code, execute the following commands in your local command shell or terminal
```
git push heroku main
```

# 5. Database Setup : Using Heroku Postgres
In this step, you will create database to store user information, activities information
## 5.1 Create Database

- You may select "Hobby Dev - Free" which allow to store up to 10,000 rows then click "Submit Order Form" to create postgres database add-on that will link to the application
## 5.2 Create Tables and Indexes in Database
To create tables and indexes, execute following commands in your local command shell or terminal
```
heroku pg:psql
```
Send the following sql statement to create table to record invitation information
```
CREATE TABLE invites(
	invite_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	telegram_user_id INT,
	date_generated TIMESTAMP,
	code VARCHAR(255),
	is_used BOOLEAN,
